A java.util.Stream represents a sequence of elements on which one or more operations can be performed. 

Stream operations are either intermediate or terminal. While terminal operations return a result of a certain type, 
intermediate operations return the stream itself so you can chain multiple method calls in a row. Streams are created
on a source, e.g. a java.util.Collection like lists or sets (maps are not supported). Stream operations can either
be executed sequential or parallel.
